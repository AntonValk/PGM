# PGM
Probabilistic Graphical Models - COMP - 767

Code on Twisted SMC sampler adapted from here: https://github.com/freli005/smc-pgm-twist
Note that the code in the linbked repo is missing a utils and won't run.

The code in my repo will run since the file that was added (the smc resampling file).
Resampling is adapted from here: https://github.com/naesseth/smc-pgm

I wrote all the IPython code and the MCMC methods.
