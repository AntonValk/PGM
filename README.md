# PGM
Probabilistic Graphical Models - COMP - 767

Code on Twisted SMC sampler adapted from here: https://github.com/freli005/smc-pgm-twist
Note that the code in the linked repo is missing a matlab file in the utils folder and won't run.

The TSMC code in my repo will run since the file that was missing was added (filename: resampling.m).
Resampling is adapted from here: https://github.com/naesseth/smc-pgm

Original work: I wrote all the IPython code and the MCMC methods as well as Loopy Belief Propagation and Mean Field.
